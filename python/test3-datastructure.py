# Given two lists create a third list by picking an odd-index element from the first list and even index elements from the second.

# --> Given <---

# listOne = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
# listTwo = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28]


# ---> Expected Output <---

# Element at odd-index positions from list one
# [6, 12, 18]
# Element at even-index positions from list two
# [4, 12, 20, 28]
# Printing Final third list
# [6, 12, 18, 4, 12, 20, 28]
