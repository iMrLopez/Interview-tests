# Technical Interview Questions


This repo contains some technical tests that can be applied to candidates whenever you are interviewing them, these are split by technology and have a position level in their name, so use the one you like the most.

The idea would be to not evaluate the candidate as how they solve this, but how they approach the solution, some candidates will over-complicate stuff and some will go for the easier path, I leave on you what to prefer.
